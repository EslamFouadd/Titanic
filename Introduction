# Statistical Investigation into The Titanic Survival Prediction.

## Who would've survived the titanic?

**This is my first project on Kaggle. I will be using Statistical techniques and Python libraries to predict the Survival rate, accurately and precisely, using Machine Learning Models. The project is constructed to be concise, systematic and informative. I've used the Comparative Method (i.e., using Scientific methodologies to investigate the similarities/differences between my project and other projects).**
